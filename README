This is a project I use as basis to test various concepts.

Surely the codebase won't reflect a real example (otherwise I would be rich). 

The idea is a centralized interest points service.

The system would allow a user to find all interest points around him if provided with a location.

Interest points include : pubs, restaurant, museums, taxi stations, subway stations
